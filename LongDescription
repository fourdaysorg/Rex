#Long Description
##Which problem are we facing today?
Nowadays, most people don’t know what happens to their donations. This can lead to various cases of corruption and misunderstandings between parties. It also decreases the amount of donations because people develop trust issues with organizations. For example, some years ago in Argentina, a mafia caught a lot of products destined to donations. Also, there were some cases in which people found abandoned bottles of water in a route months after the catastrophe occurred, such as the Hurricane María in Puerto Rico.

 
What is our solution?

Our proposition is a system based on the BlockChain technology which registers all movements related to donations, with the purpose of increasing transparency and end to end control between parties. It adds a transparency in the process of donations and makes it auditable.
At the same time, this platform will allow organisations to inform which resources are required to avoid unnecessary donations. In another example, people sent too much of a specific item and as a consequence there was an overabundance of the product. In some cases, this can lead to a huge waste of resources.

Why are we using BlockChain?
The benefits of using this system are many, some of which are:
After the politics of consensus is defined and affirmed as true, you can’t go back on it. It can control where the donations are and it removes the risk of duplicate entry or fraud.
Adding this auditable mechanism all potential donors can build more trust due to the organizations reputation, causing an increase in donations. We want to restore the trust in entities and charity.
Due to the public nature of data, the donors can audit the entity where they donate. The individuals who are provided authority can view the transaction
